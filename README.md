# BattleShips
SWW Group Project

The game board is currently represented by an array of integer arrays to indicate the status of a tile:
  0 means the tile is empty.
  1 means the tile is currently occupied by a ship.
  
The file boardString was created using an array of String arrays instead. Currently not in use.
